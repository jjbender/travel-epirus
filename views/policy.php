 <p style="color:black; align=left;"> <strong> Privacy Policy - Epirus Region Portfolio </strong> </p>
 <p style="color:black;"> This website is a part of Erasmus Project held by Economics Department of University of Ioannina. Here we understand the importance of protecting an individual’s rights to privacy. We have prepared this statement to help you understand how we aim to protect the privacy of your personal information and the personal information of others, obtained through use of our websites and the associated services that we provide.
     This policy describes the way our website collects information (especially "cookies") from all end users of our Internet-based services (the “Services”).  Users include those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”), individuals who pay a fee to subscribe to our Services (“Subscribers”), and Clients for whom we create a web-site based product such as economy.id [“Client Personnel”]. Below we explain what we do with the information we collect and the choices Visitors, Subscribers and Client Personnel have concerning the collection and use of this information. <br><br>

     This privacy policy applies to all of our Services that we provide from the .id.com.au and .idnz.co.nz network of websites. We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. For further information, please contact niko@econ.uoi.gr

     First of all, travelepirus <strong> does not store any personal data</strong>. <br>

     Introduction. Our website does not store information in different ways from Visitors, Subscribers and Client Personnel who access our Services. If you use or follow a link to any of  third party websites, please be aware that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility for how they use information obtained about you from your use of their website.  It is your responsibility to read and understand the privacy policies of these entities. <br>
     Voluntary Customer Surveys: We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage you to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.
     We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residential postcode, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties. <br>
     Special Cases: It is travelepirus policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors, Subscribers or Client Personnel in ways unrelated to those described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or prohibit the unrelated use.

     Our use of cookies:  Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer’s hard disk for record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. Travelepirus uses cookies to make your use of our website and services as convenient as possible. Cookies do not themselves personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s browser. Cookies allow us to remember the information you have entered as you move through our website, and tell us how many people are using the different parts of the website. If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies, however, this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of all aspects of our website. Please be aware that if you visit other external websites they may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.<br>

     Public Forums: Please remember that any information you may disclose in any public areas of our website or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas.  We accept no responsibility for your participation in a public forum.<br>

     Travelepirus Commitment to Data Security: Our Services and websites have reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining this information.<br>

     Status of this policy: Your use of our website constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this privacy policy, as revised by us from time to time. Technologies and information governance practices are constantly developing.  We will therefore need to revise this privacy policy in future, so please review this page regularly to ensure that you are aware of any changes to its terms.<br>

     Privacy Complaints: Please direct all privacy complaints to our privacy compliance officer. A privacy complaint relates to any concern or dispute that you have with our privacy practices as it relates to your personal information.  At all times, privacy complaints will be treated seriously, dealt with promptly, and in a confidential manner. If you are unsatisfied with the outcome of your complaint, you may refer your complaint to the email niko@econ.uoi.gr </p>
